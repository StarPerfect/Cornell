    "* Use the ```sns.catplot``` function to create a boxplot of the distribution of mpg values for each separate make of car.  The ```sns.catplot``` function is similar to the ```sns.boxplot``` function used above, in that you can specify the name of a dataframe to use along with the names of x and y columns of interest.  Since there are a large number of different makes, you might want to use some of the optional arguments to catplot in order to make the figure larger.\n",

While you will be using the ```kind='box'``` option for your plot, you will find examples of ```kind='violin'``` and ```kind='count'``` on the page linked above."
