You can read more about the Wheat and Chessboard problem on [this page on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_and_chessboard_problem).

There is a function named <code>plt.semilogy</code> for making the y-axis logarithmic, and one named <code>plt.semilogx</code> for making the x-axis logarithmic. If you wanted to make both axes logarithmic (sometimes referred to as a \"log-log plot\"), you could call the function <code>plt.loglog</code>.  (Alternatively, instead of using the plotting functions to represent logarithmic data, you could compute directly the logarithm of the wheat data and plot it on a linear scale, by transforming it using an appropriate function in numpy <code>np</code>, e.g., <code>np.log2</code> or <code>np.log10</code>.)"
