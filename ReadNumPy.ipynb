    "NumPy provides various ways of reading arrays from files, whether they are written as ASCII text (\"plain text\") or in a specialized binary format.

Jupyter notebooks provide a capability for executing commands in the shell, or command line, external to the notebook, by beginning a command with the \"!\" character (exclamation point, or \"bang\").  The Linux command \"ls\" lists the contents in the current directory.  We can execute this command from within the notebook by entering and evaluating the expression ```!ls```.  (You could also list the contents of the directory with the ```%ls``` magic function, but since we'll be issuing a few additional commands below that don't have magic function equivalents, we might as well use the \"!\" notation for all of them.)\n",

The advantage of saving files to binary format is that the data are stored to full precision, along with information about their dtype, and binary files can be smaller than a text file encoding the same data.
